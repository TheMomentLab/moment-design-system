## Montserrat

The outlined `ROBOTICS` wordmark is generated from Montserrat ExtraBold 800.
The canonical fixed `PORTAL` product name and parent-brand-first `ProductLockup`
product names are generated from Montserrat SemiBold 600. Both fonts are Version
7.222 static fonts obtained from the official Montserrat v7.222 release. The
exact TTF files are retained as build-time sources only; they are not loaded by
the LDS runtime and do not replace Pretendard as the UI typeface.

## Pretendard

LDS embeds unmodified Pretendard v1.3.9 webfonts for interface typography.

- Pinned release: https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard/releases/tag/v1.3.9

- Full license: `assets/fonts/Pretendard-LICENSE.txt`

## Noto Sans KR

The outlined `주식회사 엘케이로보틱스` corporate descriptor is generated
from the unmodified Noto Sans KR variable TTF at the named ExtraBold
`wght=800` instance, with `0.105em` tracking and uniform scaling. The pinned
font is retained as a build-time source only; production logo SVGs contain
paths and do not load Noto Sans KR at runtime.

## Moment Lab fork (2026-09-07)

Moment Design System derives from LDS 0.2.2 (6e037c2a90af28f57139083c16d8cd514940a12a). Changes: Moment theme mapping, original Moment mark supplied by the user, editorial compositions, standalone distribution and Storybook. Original source and notices remain preserved. The Moment brand assets are supplied for this brand, not a general trademark license.

Self-hosted Space Grotesk and JetBrains Mono were retrieved from Google Fonts on 2026-09-07 under SIL OFL 1.1. Font license texts are included in packages/moment/assets/fonts (assets/fonts in the packed distribution), alongside the inherited Pretendard license.
